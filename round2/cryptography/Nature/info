In ciphered city where only secrets exists
Perceive was in you from the beginning
In dreams we roam, truths we encrypt
  Forever bond to motherland 

  Fair countries of the whole world
Strengthen the joint alliance
Undauntedly courage, with all our might
Let's raise our beloved Mongolia

Reverse the secret
Reveal the truth
